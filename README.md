Auxonomy: An MMO game for bots
==================

# Overview

Auxonomy (working title) is a server-side persistent environment that consists of a functionally infinite grid of square spaces. This grid is "inhabited" by autonomous agents, i.e. "bots", that can travel across the grid, gather resources, build structures, engage in combat with one another, reproduce, etc. The intelligence for these bots comes from scripts provided by human players. These scripts are executed server-side rather than the players' clients. Thus, human players have no direct control over their bots; rather, players are challenged to build artificial intelligences that can maximize the likelihood of their bots surviving
